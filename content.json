In 2015 it makes sense to use NVM. NVM InstallationInstructions. Update NPM: npm install npm@latest -g Hexo: why can’t you use helper functions in source code?This should be in docs. Creating a Custom Index File in HexoTrying to generate a custom index file in source, hexo would ignoresource/index.md no matter what I did. What I had to do was uninstallhexo-generator-index. Seehere. Then it works. So, thatwill be part of the setup for my theme. But, it’s worth it in order to properlyseperate the theme from the content, I think. Having everyone edit the themeindex.ejs template is no good. Hexo Rendering Raw EJS File Problem I EncounteredSometimes the server would keep rendering an old version of my code, but astext. So I’d see stuff like &lt;% if (site.tags.length){ %&gt; The raw ejs, essentially. Restarting the server or running hexo clean didn’tdo anything. After some time, I realized it was due to the gedit swap files being read byhexo as the actual layout files: for example, tag.ejs~. My partial helperslooked like: &lt;%- partial(&#39;_partials/tag&#39;) %&gt;, and apparently hexo was readingin tag.ejs~ instead of tag.ejs. And therefore, the ejs wasn’t rendering. To fix this, I simply changed my partial helper to &lt;%- partial(&#39;_partials/tag.ejs&#39;) %&gt;. Problem solved. Hexo Excerpt VariableI was confused by the behavior of the hexo excerpt variable. If you defineexcerpt: something in the front matter, hexo ignores that. Instead, to get itto work, one needs to add a &lt;!-- more --&gt; comment in the source of the post.Or, you can install a plugin that allows you to define custom excerpt in thefront matter. Scripts DirectoryOne of the things I really discovered too late is the “Scripts” directory in thetheme folder. In Hexo, the various plugins drive the structure of the site, asopposed to the placement of different files and directories, as in Jekyll. Theplugins programatically create folder structure, etc, where in Jekyll I mostlyused the liquid markup to structure the site. The problem is, then, that the user wants to extend hexo to do some sort ofcustom thing. If one had to publish a new plugin, that’d be too much work. Butthe theme level scripts folder allows one to extend the base hexo functionalityin ‘user space’ effectively.","categories":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/categories/Hexo/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Programming","slug":"Programming","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/tags/Programming/"},{"name":"Design","slug":"Design","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/tags/Design/"}]},{"title":"How To Impress Employers at Infosessions","slug":"2015-05-02-How-To-Impress","date":"2015-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2017-03-16T07:54:28.989Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/05/02/2015-05-02-How-To-Impress/","link":"","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/2015/05/02/2015-05-02-How-To-Impress/","excerpt":"Top tech talent knows that industry recruiters often bring a stack ofpre-negotiated offers to university infosessions, so that they can snagprogrammers and UX designers who really stand out.

Here are some of tips for optimizing your infosession performance: Ask questions to get a feel for the company’s culture. For example, I alwaysstart off by asking “do you have a mandatory drug test?”. Make sure that the recruiters know you’re passionate about the company bycrying. Don’t be that awkward guy who goes up for more pizza while the presenter isproviding valuable information about the company’s agile development cycle.Instead, demonstrate your ability to amortize I/O costs via bulk loading:bring a whole box of pizza back to your seat. Protip: “free swag” t-shirtsmake great face rags, so grab a handful. Stay focused by minimizing distractions. I typically wear my BoseQuietComfort noise cancelling headphones during the presentation. This way Iretain more information from the PowerPoint, which really impresses therecruiters during the networking session. Follow me on Spotify to check outmy special “Let’s Do This Infosession” playlist. Getting invited to the ‘after-infosession’ is critical. During the networkingsession, ask the recruiters what hotel they’re staying at, and make sure thatthey know that you ‘know a guy’. Without fail, someone will slip a wax-sealedenvelope under your door at midnight, the coveted invitation to an another, moreexclusive networking event. If you follow these simple tips and brush up on your data structures, you’llsoon be literally drowning in offers, like everyone else. If these tips don’twork out for you, you probably need to get your MEng.","categories":[{"name":"Humor","slug":"Humor","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/categories/Humor/"}],"tags":[{"name":"funny","slug":"funny","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/tags/funny/"},{"name":"employment","slug":"employment","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/tags/employment/"}]},{"title":"NAV Web Service Programming Resources","slug":"2015-04-08-NAV-Programming-Resources","date":"2015-04-07T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2017-03-16T07:54:28.989Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/04/08/2015-04-08-NAV-Programming-Resources/","link":"","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/2015/04/08/2015-04-08-NAV-Programming-Resources/","excerpt":"","text":"Here are some of the resources I found helpful for learning to develop Dynamics NAV web service based applications. C/AL Programming:Introduction to CAL ProgrammingThis provides a good overview of the basics of CAL programming, which can become necessary in building a web service applications when a custom codeunit or page extension is required. Setting up Web Services:Vjecko Web Service Recorded SessionVjecko.com has a lot of detailed articles about web service programming, but this older post has a pdf and recorded session that shows how to expose and connect to web services from a .NET application. Unfortunately, he shows how to create Web Service references in .NET using the now-deprecated Web Refrence method (from .NET 2) instead of the more current Service Reference method. Using Service Reference to Connect to Web ServicesThis explains how to use Service Reference, using code instead of XML web.config configuration, which I found difficult to configure. (Each time I updated the service reference, I would have to reconfigure the XML). NAV Upgrade Process:Migration to SQL Server from C/SIDE DatabaseIn order to use web services, you don’t need to be using the Role Tailored Client, but you must be using the a SQL server based NAV database. Web Services can be configured and exposed using the Classic Client for SQL Server Databases. Debugging Code Called by Web ServicesC/AL code won’t necessarily execute the same as it did in the Classic Client when called as a Web Service. C/AL code called as web service execute in the NAV Server tier, instead of the client. Certain functions aren’t available for code running in the NAV Server, and some design changes need to be made (for example, CONFIRM dialogue boxes don’t make sense in the context of a web service). To debug the codeunits called through web services (or the Role Tailored Client), you will need to use Visual Studio.More information. Deploying a .NET Application:Deploying to IIS After you’ve built a .NET application that consumes .NET web services, you’ll have to find a way to deploy it on your servers, or Azure. Connection strings can be used to specify different NAV servers for different environments (like development, QA, and prod).","categories":[{"name":"Dynamics NAV","slug":"Dynamics-NAV","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/categories/Dynamics-NAV/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Resources","slug":"Resources","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/tags/Resources/"},{"name":"NAV","slug":"NAV","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/tags/NAV/"}]},{"title":"Adding Lookup Field to a Page in Dynamics NAV","slug":"2015-04-05-Lookup-on-Page","date":"2015-04-04T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2017-03-16T07:54:28.989Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/04/05/2015-04-05-Lookup-on-Page/","link":"","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/2015/04/05/2015-04-05-Lookup-on-Page/","excerpt":"","text":"One of the problems I faced in building a non-trivial application that consumedNAV Web Services was figuring out how to “join” fields from different tables.For example, when exposing a list of jobs from a job table which includes aresource needed for the job, you might need more than just the resource idthat’s a field in the table: you might also need the resource name anddescription. While this is easy to get for one record, what about when youneed a few hundred records in a table that has been dynamically filtered? Whenexposing a Page as a web service, it’s easy to include the fields of the tablethat the page is based on, but it’s less clear how to include fields fromanother table. Forum posts like this led me to believe that I couldn’t expose flow fields in a Page web service, and I would get exceptions when I tried to expose all the fields of a table. In fact, it’s perfectly possible to expose a flow field: it’s flow filters that don’t work with web services. But, I also didn’t want to modify the underlying [job] table to add a flow field, and didn’t see an easy way of adding a flow field to a Page. I tried “joining” the data in the C# application, but found network overhead made the application unusuably slow. The solution to this problem was to use C/AL code to the Page to effectively create a lookup / flow field. This way, the data is “pre-joined” before leaving the NAV Server, which is fast and clean, but you didn’t modify any tables. Here’s how it’s done: Step 1. Add a Field with SourceExpression Set to a Function Name To start, we create a Page using the wizard that includes all of the fields of an underlying table. Then, we create manually add fields that will contain the lookup data from other tables. The text in the SourceExpression column will be the name of the function that populates this field. Step 2. Create Function in the Page’s C/AL Code With the Page field designer open, go to the functions tab of C/AL Globals form, and add a function with the name of the text in the SourceExpression column. Set the return type of the function with the “Locals” button, and a function trigger will appear in the C/AL code editor for your page. Add code to the body of the function trigger that will be called for each record to provide a value for the field.","categories":[{"name":"Dynamics NAV","slug":"Dynamics-NAV","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/categories/Dynamics-NAV/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Resources","slug":"Resources","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/tags/Resources/"},{"name":"NAV","slug":"NAV","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/tags/NAV/"}]},{"title":"Static NGINX Locations","slug":"2015-04-01-NGINX-Static-Locations","date":"2015-03-31T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2017-03-16T07:54:28.989Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/04/01/2015-04-01-NGINX-Static-Locations/","link":"","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/2015/04/01/2015-04-01-NGINX-Static-Locations/","excerpt":"","text":"I try to get a lot of mileage out of the single AWS t2.micro instance I keep running,which means I have many different projects running on different paths on a single server. Everytime I finish a project, I have to relearn how to add new “locations” (paths) to the NGINX virtual host. I was really frustrated when I couldn’t figure out how to add a static location for the Jekyllwebsite I created for the game I’m developing. I kept trying to do something like this: location / { root /home/ubuntu/personal-website; } location /array { root /home/ubuntu/array-website/_site; } But everytime I tried to visit [http://ptsteadman.com/array], I would get a 404 error.I tried a bunch of things: I changed the “root” of the the / location to my game website, and it worked. But no matter what I did, after using sudo service nginx restart,trying to visit the /array location still resulted in a 404. I couldn’t add the new route/location. Eventually, I realized that the text after the slash in the location is the directory thatNGINX will try to find in the “root” location. So, location /array will look for the directory (or file)array in whatever directory “root” is set to. So, I created a symlink to the root of mystatic jekyll site with the command ln -s /home/ubuntu/array-website/_site /home/ubuntu/array, andthen I could set up my nginx config file in sites-enabled as below: location / { root /home/ubuntu/personal-website; } location /array { root /home/ubuntu; } I think this stuff is all pretty obvious to someone who really understands NGINX and file serving,but I only touch NGINX when I’ve finished a project and feel impatient to deploy. I think it’s very confusingthat NGINX seems to handle paths differently between / locations and and /foo locations,but a real understanding of NGINX might clear things up.","categories":[{"name":"NGINX","slug":"NGINX","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/categories/NGINX/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Web Development","slug":"Web-Development","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/tags/Web-Development/"}]},{"title":"Spaces for Newline Indents in VS","slug":"2015-03-23-Make-VS-Insert-Spaces","date":"2015-03-22T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2017-03-16T07:54:28.989Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/03/23/2015-03-23-Make-VS-Insert-Spaces/","link":"","permalink":"https://yangdon.github.io/2015/03/23/2015-03-23-Make-VS-Insert-Spaces/","excerpt":"","text":"It’s really annoying when Visual Studio shows you this: But github or vim shows you the same file like this: If you use the “show whitespace” Visual Studio chord (CTRL-R, CTRL-W),you’ll see that visual studio inserts tabs instead of spaces bydefault for newline indent: Visual Studio displays tabs as having the samewidth as four spaces.
